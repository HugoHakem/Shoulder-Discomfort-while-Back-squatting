# Shoulder-Discomfort-while-Back-squatting
Matlab model to study the effect of the barbell positioning on the shoulders and of the hand spacing on this barbell on the orientation of the shoulder joint reaction force in athlete performing back-squat.

# Abstract

	This study has been intended to provide guidance for athlete who want to reduce their shoulder discomfort while doing back squat. Two parameters have been studied, the barbell positioning on the shoulder ∆H, varying from the upper to the lower portion of the rear deltoid and the hand spacing on the barbell ∆H_and, measured from the edge of the shoulder. A biomechanical static analysis has been performed and solved on MATLAB. The shoulder discomfort has been measured as being directly correlated with the orientation of the shoulder joint reaction force in the frontal and sagittal plane. Optimal values for ∆H and ∆H_and have thus been determined by minimizing the shoulder discomfort. Finally, the impact of morphology on these optimal positions have been studied. Overall, a small ∆H, or a high barbell positioning is preferred but individual with longer humerus or forearm would feel more comfortable with a low barbell positioning. The hand spacing ∆H_and must stay between 70% to 80% of the arm length, but a grip closer from the higher end may be preferred for individual with longer forearm. In any case, having hands too close from the body and a low barbell positioning must be avoid.
